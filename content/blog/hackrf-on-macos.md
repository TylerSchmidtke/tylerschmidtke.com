## Introduction

I recently picked up a HackRF to learn more about SDR and RF in general. The HackRF seemed like a great choice for
getting started learning about SDR, especially given the wide range of content for learning SDR and signals processing
with it, along with the Portapack for using it without a computer. I decided to start with Michael
Ossmann's [Great Scott Gadgets SDR Course](https://greatscottgadgets.com/sdr/), and hit the ground running, or at least
attempted to.

Getting GNURadio installed for the first lesson initially seemed straightforward, but I ran into a couple of snags and
wanted to share the resolution for anyone else that might be using a HackRF on MacOS.

## Getting Started

While it might be tempting to use Homebrew to install [GNURadio](https://gnuradio.org), I found that the Homebrew
install was missing some components that were used in the first lesson, namely the `osmocom Source` block. I then set
off to install the [gr-osmosdr](https://osmocom.org/projects/gr-osmosdr/wiki/GrOsmoSDR) module from source, which
seemingly went fine, but I honestly didn't have a clue
where to set the library path so that GNURadio could find the module. I found that I could install GNURadio and
gr-osmosdr via MacPorts which I wasn't too keen on, so I poked around a bit more and found that GNURadio and gr-osmosdr 
(packaged as gnuradio-osmosdr) could be installed using Anaconda. This simplified the installation process and everything 
was up and running in no time.

### Installing MiniConda

I didn't want the full Anaconda distribution, so I opted to
install [MiniConda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), which is a minimal installer for Anaconda which
primarily
includes the package and virtual environment manager, `conda`. If you don't have a Homebrew installation of Python,
start
by installing the latest with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
brew install python3
```

Next use Homebrew again to install MiniConda:

```bash
brew install miniconda
```

### Installing GNURadio and gnuradio-osmosdr

With `miniconda` installed, we can use it to install `gnuadio` and the `gnuradio-osmosdr` module:

1. Start by creating a new conda environment:

    ```bash
    conda create -n gnuradio
    ```

2. Activate the new environment:

    ```bash
    conda activate gnuradio
    ```

3. Install GNURadio and gnuradio-osmosdr:

    ```bash
     conda config --env --add channels conda-forge
     conda config --env --set channel_priority strict
     conda install gnuradio gnuradio-osmosdr
     ```

### Installing HackRF Tools

If you haven't already, make sure that you install the HackRF tools:

```bash
brew install hackrf
```

This includes the `hackrf_info` which is useful for verifying that your HackRF is connected and working properly:

```bash
‚ùØ hackrf_info
hackrf_info version: 2023.01.1
libhackrf version: 2023.01.1 (0.8)
Found HackRF
Index: 0
Serial number: <redacted>
Board ID Number: 4 (HackRF One)
Firmware Version: n_230813 (API:1.07)
Part ID Number: <redacted>
Hardware Revision: r9
Hardware appears to have been manufactured by Great Scott Gadgets.
Hardware supported by installed firmware:
    HackRF One
```

It also provides the `hackrf_spiflash` utility for flashing new firmware. If you haven't done this already, check out
the instructions in the docs: [Updating Firmware](https://hackrf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/updating_firmware.html).

## Trying Out GNURadio

To verify that everything is installed correctly, open `gnuradio-companion` from with your `gnuradio` conda environment
activated. You should see something like this:

![GNURadio Companion](/img/hackrf-on-macos/gnuradio-companion.png)

Click the Search button in the menu bar and search for `osmocom Source` in the blocks library on the right. You should
see the `osmocom Source` block in the list. Drag it onto the canvas. Next double click the `osmocom Source` block to
open
its settings. Verify that the `Sample Rate` is set to `samp_rate` to reference the predefined variable and set the
`Ch0: Frequency (Hz)` to `10e6` to set the frequency to 10 MHz. This is the frequency that the HackRF will receive.

Next, search for `QT GUI Frequency Sink` and drag it onto the canvas as well. Finally, connect the two blocks by
clicking and dragging from the output of the `osmocom Source` block to the input of the `QT GUI Frequency Sink` block.
Finally, click the `Options` block that is on the canvas by default and set an `id`. Your canvas should look something
like this:

![GNURadio Companion with Osmocom Source and QT GUI Frequency Sink](/img/hackrf-on-macos/gnuradio-companion-with-source.png)

Click the Play button in the menu bar to start the flow graph. You should see a window open with a frequency graph:

## Conclusion

If you found yourself here after getting a HackRF of your own, I hope this saved you some time getting started. Happy
hacking!
